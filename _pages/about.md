The last decade saw Computer Science turn inwards and build stronger machines to advance technology. However, today it is no longer about stretching the boundaries of Moore’s Law. We believe that the upcoming decade is when the field shall turn outwards, welcoming collaborations in various interdisciplinary areas of study. **The CrossThink** is an initiative in this direction, led by the students of Ashoka University.

The current landing page is based on the open-source **Memoirs Jekyll theme** in action.
