I"£<p>The last decade saw Computer Science turn inwards and build stronger machines to advance technology. However, today it is no longer about stretching the boundaries of Mooreâ€™s Law. We believe that the upcoming decade is when the field shall turn outwards, welcoming collaborations in various interdisciplinary areas of study. <strong>The CrossThink</strong> is an initiative in this direction, led by the students of Ashoka University.</p>
