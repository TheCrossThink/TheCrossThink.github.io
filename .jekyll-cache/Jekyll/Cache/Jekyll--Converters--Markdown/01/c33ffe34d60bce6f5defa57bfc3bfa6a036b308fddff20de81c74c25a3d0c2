I"‘<p>Naming an interdiscplinary student-led Computer Science Journal for the 21st Century is no easy task. You need to maintain delicate balances of wit vs esotericism and clever vs wannabe. We wanted a name that spoke for itself. Yes, itâ€™s ironic that weâ€™re writing an entire post about it.</p>

<p>Computer Science today is a lot more than advancing Mooreâ€™s Law. Itâ€™s over-encompassing nature naturally spills over to multiple disciplines effortlessly. This also leads to issues in these intersections that have never existed before. Atleast not in the real world.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Always eyes watching you and the voice enveloping you. Asleep or awake, indoors or out of doors, in the bath or bedâ€”no escape. Nothing was your own except the few cubic centimeters in your skull.</p>

<p>However fiction doesnâ€™t need to confine itself within the mundane boundaries of reality, does it? Thanks to Orwellâ€™s classic curriculum-staple, dystopian novel 1984, we always had a frame of reference that is unfortunately turning into the present-day reality.</p>

<p><strong>CrossThink</strong> is a word in Newspeak, the fictional dialect of Oceania: the totalitarian superstate that is the setting of Orwellâ€™s Nineteen Eighty-Four. It is a noun-verb, and can be used as either, in conventional English. It refers to the cross-pollination of thought that we expect to bring about in our journal.</p>
